# 🍕 QuickByte Express – Crisis Impact & Recovery Strategy (2025)

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project analyzes the business impact of a crisis period on QuickByte Express, a multi-city food delivery platform operating across major Indian metros.

Using Power BI and DAX-based KPI modeling, I performed a full diagnostic analysis across:

- Revenue performance
- Order volume trends
- Customer retention
- Operational delays
- Cancellation rates
- Customer sentiment
- Restaurant-level risk exposure

The objective was not just to measure the damage — but to design a structured recovery strategy.

## 🎯 Business Problem

During the 2025 crisis period, the company experienced a sharp decline in revenue and customer engagement.

Management needed clarity on:

- What caused the revenue collapse?
- Was the issue operational or customer-driven?
- Which cities and restaurants were highest risk?
- How severe was the retention breakdown?
- What actions should be prioritized for recovery?
